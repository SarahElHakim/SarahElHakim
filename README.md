## Profile

I am a highly curious and motivated person who is focused on learning in all parts of life whether personal or professional. I have always been passionate about solving problems and I strive to find the best solution whether by researching or experimenting. I hold a BSc(Hons) in Forensic Science, have hands-on experience in toxicology research, and completed a Cybersecurity Bootcamp. 

My background in Forensic Science has equipped me with a sharp analytical mindset, attention to detail, and a methodical approach to problem solving. Throughout my cybersecurity bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience in threat analysis, penetration testing, and risk mitigation, working with tools such as Python and Kali Linux. I have experience working as a Forensic Toxicology Researcher where I learnt how to work with complex data while adhering to industry standards and presenting technical findings clearly to different stakeholders.
