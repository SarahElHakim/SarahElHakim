## Profile

Since I was a child I have been interested in developing a career in Forensic Science and Cyber Security. I have always been inquisitive and love to systematically solve problems via analytical solutions to achieve objectives. 

I have a First-Class Honours degree in Forensic Science, and experience working as a Forensic Toxicology Researcher and am currently completing a Cybersecurity Bootcamp with HyperionDev to develop my technical skills as well as my cyber security skills.

I am hard working, setting myself high standards of performance and accuracy. Being creative I welcome highly analytical challenges and enjoy investigating situations and absorbing information on a variety of subjects. I take an energetic approach to my work and enjoy tasks that require a high level of attention to detail. 

The contribution I will make to an organisation is my commitment to quality and standards. At the same time I will willingly comply with the relevant rules and regulations. I am adept at either working alone or within a team. I can absorb detail, detect errors and offer an objective rather than emotional appraisal of a situation.
